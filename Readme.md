###About

####The Program

Outnet is a primarily PHP web server system built to be installed on a linux distribution. It features group-based project management and individual user permissions. Groups are hidden from view unless they are made public.

Users within the groups will be able to download and upload files, as well as engage in group chat, both logged and direct.

Outnet will also feature security features such as _"Nuke"_ (Destroyes the group and everything in it) and _"Dump\_to\_email"_ (Sends all files, pages, and content, not includng user lists to a pre-determined email address) for situations where security has been compromised. 

#####Note:

this software is in fact in development. Some concerns (No encryption for passwords, lack of ssl support, does not work on non-linux devices, insecure use of variables, etc.) have been noted, but are not yet being corrected.
